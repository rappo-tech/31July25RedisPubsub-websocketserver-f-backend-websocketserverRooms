page.tsx==>create.tsx
websocketserver.ts
route.ts==>sendWebsocket.ts

1st send msg to websocket and get back the response  and eventually 
send msg to all client who connncetd with port 8080
then
call sendWebsocket.ts   to save data in database
bcoz by doing so i will aachive 2 thing 
1.send msg to all clinet quickly 
2.also save msg to db  
but in doing so 1msg is sent fine and websocketserver and route.ts
is also working fine but 2nd msg theer is lot of post/api call is 
happining continous why??
